# CS320_Portfolio
Course: Software Test, Automation, and Quality Assurance

This repository contains artifacts from my CS 320 projects, including contact service classes, unit tests, and my Project Two summary and reflection. Together, these artifacts demonstrate my understanding of software testing, automation, and quality assurance practices.

How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

I ensure my software is functional by writing unit tests that validate both normal behavior and edge cases before code is finalized. Using JUnit tests helped me confirm that each method behaves as expected and fails safely when given invalid input. From a security perspective, I focus on input validation, enforcing constraints, and preventing invalid or malicious data from being stored or processed. Testing early and often helped me catch logic flaws before they became larger problems.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

I start by carefully reading and breaking down the requirements to understand what the user actually needs versus what might be implied. In CS 320, this meant translating requirements into test cases before writing the full implementation. Writing tests first helped me stay aligned with user expectations and avoid adding unnecessary features. If the code passes all requirement-based tests, I know it meets the user’s needs.

How do I approach designing software?

I approach software design by keeping it modular, readable, and testable. I separate responsibilities into different classes and methods so each part of the program has a clear purpose. Designing with testing in mind helps me write cleaner code that is easier to debug and maintain. This course reinforced the idea that good design and good testing go hand in hand.
